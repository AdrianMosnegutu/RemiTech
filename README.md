# RemiTech Fictional Website

## Side project for Codecademy.com

This website was made as an open-ended project during the Front-End Development course.
It utilizes concepts such as semantic HTML, advanced styling with CSS and responsive
design.

It functions as the main website for the fictional company RemiTech, located in France.
The webpage is structured in 5 main sections: the hero, About, Products, News and Team.

The about section describes what makes the company stand out as not only a tech company,
but also as a learning hub and a family.

The products section lists some of their latest products. Each product contains a splash
image, the product title, the date of release, a small description, a star rating and a
link to the product's webpage.

The news section displays on one hand the latest news article, and on the other hand a
list of previous news articles.

Lastly, the team section lists the major members of the RemiTech family: the CEO, head
of marketing, lead designer and product manager.

This project was meant to serve as a playground to test my practical knowledge about basic HTML and CSS concepts, as well as advanced concepts like flexbox and viewport scaling.
