It functions as the main website for the fictional company RemiTech, located in France. The webpage is structured in 5 main sections: the hero, About, Products, News and Team.

The about section describes what makes the company stand out as not only a tech company,but also as a learning hub and a family.

The products section lists some of their latest products. Each product contains a splash image, the product title, the date of release, a small description, a star rating and a link to the product's webpage.

This project was meant to serve as a playground to test my practical knowledge about basic HTML and CSS concepts, as well as advanced concepts like flexbox and viewport scaling.
